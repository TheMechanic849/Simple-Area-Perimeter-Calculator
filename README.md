Hi my first project ever in python, made in class
------------------------------------------------------
hope you like it ,its so simple, but a test for me to continue :)

This is a simple area and perimeter calculator for the basics like squares , rectangles and Triangles

How it works:
--> for the squares you will need  the variable "sides" to define the square side;

--> for the rectangles you will need to use the "sides" variable again , but you will need to separate the numbers by "/";
    Ex: 2.5/3

--> for the area of the triangles you will need to use the variables "base" for the base of the triangle ,
    and "height" for the height of the triangle;

--> for the perimeter of the triangle you will need to use "base" again and "sides" just like the rectangles   

Call commands:

--> "from Calculator.Square import squarearea" for the square area; 
--> "from Calculator.Square import squareperimeter" for the square perimeter;
--> "from Calculator.Rectangule import rectarea"  for the rectangle area;
--> "from Calculator.Rectangule import rectperimeter" for the rectangle perimeter;
--> "from Calculator.Triangule import triangarea"  for the triangle area;
--> "from Calculator.Triangule import triangperimeter" for the triangle perimeter;
